/**
 * Starts and stops the wake-word pipeline.

 * The pipeline runs in [WakeChatService], a foreground service that keeps
 * listening while the app is minimized, so its state cannot live in a view model
 * that only exists while the app is open. This class holds none of it: it only
 * asks the service to start or stop.
 *
 * It renders nothing. The wake chat has one rendering - the voice-interaction
 * window the system draws over every screen, which covers this app's own surface
 * too - so there is no card here to forward the exchange to.
