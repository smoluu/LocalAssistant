/**
 * Finding out whether the platform has made this app its default digital
 * assistant, and opening the Settings page that lets the user do it.
 *
 * The assistant role is the platform's own mechanism: an app that declares a
 * voice-interaction service is eligible for [RoleManager.ROLE_ASSISTANT] and the
 * system "Default digital assistant" picker is what binds that role. Reading it
 * here is what lets the app tell the user "you have not set me as the
 * assistant" instead of silently listening forever behind a notification nobody
 * taps.
 *
 * [RoleManager] is the generic role API - the same one used for
 * `ROLE_MICROPHONE`-style capabilities - and `ROLE_ASSISTANT` is the role the
 * voice-interaction service makes the app eligible for. Older platforms have no
 * such role, so every entry point here answers "unknown" rather than guessing,
 * and the settings page is reached through its documented activity keys instead.
 *
 * A vendor build may implement its own picker that only records the choice in
 * `Settings.Secure` and never grants the role; this toolchain cannot name
 * [android.app.ComponentName] or [android.content.Settings], so the platform's
 * own `isActiveService` test cannot be reached here and the role query alone
 * would report "not held" for a user who has set the picker.
 *
 * The reachable half of the truth is [voiceInteractionBound]: the platform calls
 * [WakeChatService.onReady] only after it has resolved this app as its
 * voice-interaction manager, so the service records the binding itself. Both
 * halves are in the same process (the foreground service runs inside the app),
 * which is why this is a plain module value rather than a SharedPreferences
 * entry - those stores belong to the Context that created them, and the settings
 * screen and the service are different Contexts.
