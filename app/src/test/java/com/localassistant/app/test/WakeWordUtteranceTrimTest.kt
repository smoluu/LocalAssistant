/**
 * The wake recorder's cut to the utterance has to be gain-independent.
 *
 * The matcher normalises gain before it compares anything, so the clip it is handed has to be
 * cut on the same scale. The recorder used to cut at an absolute RMS, and the tab showed what
 * that costs: the same phrase spoken at arm's length fell under the absolute cut and kept only
 * its loudest fraction of a second, so live clips of 71-139 frames were scored against enrolled
 * takes of 135-223, and that length gap alone put a genuine phrase at 0.41-0.59 against a 0.38
 * bar - every sensitivity missed, whatever the slider was set to.
 *
 * [voicedSpan] keys the cut to the clip's own loudest window, which makes the span invariant
 * under gain: enrollment and the live pass are one phrase at two loudnesses, and they have to
 * arrive at the same length.
