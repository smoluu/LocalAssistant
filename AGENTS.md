# LocalAssistant - AI Agent Guide

## Project Overview

LocalAssistant is a local-first Android voice assistant: it captures audio on-device and calls
user-configured local endpoints for LLM, STT and TTS. Nothing is sent to a cloud service and no
endpoint is hardcoded.

Two voice paths coexist: the in-app pipeline (`VoiceAssistantService`, mic button on the chat
screen) and the hands-free wake chat (`WakeChatService`), a foreground service that matches an
enrolled phrase on-device, runs record → STT → LLM → TTS, keeps the mic live between turns, and
draws the exchange in a platform `VoiceInteractionSession` window - the only rendering that exists
while the app is minimized.

## Local Development Setup

Machine-specific facts (local endpoints, adb device, build/deploy commands, the vendor assistant
picker) live in `AGENTS.local.md`, which is **git-ignored**. Read it when working on that machine;
never commit it and never copy its specifics into this file.

## Tech Stack
- Kotlin 1.9+, JVM target 17; Jetpack Compose Material3 + Navigation Compose; MVVM (`AndroidViewModel` + `StateFlow`)
- Room (single table `chat_messages`) · SharedPreferences for settings, not DataStore · kotlinx.serialization on `ChatMessage`, org.json for API bodies
- OkHttp + SSE streaming · `AudioRecord` for capture, `AudioTrack` for playback (no `MediaRecorder`)
- compileSdk/minSdk/targetSdk = 35 (Android 12); packages under `com.localassistant.app.*`

## Architecture
- `domain/model/` - `ChatMessage`, `MessageRole`, `AppSettings` (every config field)
- `data/local/` - `LocalAssistantDatabase`, `ChatMessageDao`
- `data/remote/` - `ApiClient`: `chatCompletion` (SSE), `transcribeAudio`, `synthesizeSpeech`, `fetchModels`, `fetchVoices`
- `data/settings/` - `SettingsRepository` (SharedPreferences; presets are hand-built JSON)
- `service/` - `VoiceAssistantService` (in-app pipeline) · `WakeChatService` (hands-free pipeline; **is** an `android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionService`) · `WakeChatSessionService` (its drawing half) · `WakeChatRecognitionService` (hollow `RecognitionService` stub the manifest resource requires)
- `ui/chat/` - `ChatViewModel` + `ChatScreen` (the only conversation history; carries `VoiceControlsBar`)
- `ui/wake/` - `WakeChatViewModel` only: a thin forwarder of the service's `StateFlow`s and start/stop intents. The in-app card renderer was deleted - the session window is the single rendering of an exchange.
- `ui/settings/` - `SettingsViewModel` + `SettingsScreen` (presets, model fetching, wake enrollment, wake-chat section, adb debug trigger)
- `ui/common/` - `CommonUtilities.kt` (VAD recording, WAV, TTS playback) · `WakeWordDetector.kt` (MFCC + DTW matcher against enrolled references) · `DefaultAssistant.kt` (assistant-role oracle + picker intents)
- `ui/theme/` - `Theme.kt` Gruvbox schemes · `receiver/` boot + network restarters · `widget/` home-screen mic control
- `ui/MainActivity.kt` - entry point and navigation graph; **do not edit**

## Coding Standards & Conventions
- `StateFlow` for all reactive UI state (`asStateFlow()` when mutable internally); ViewModels extend `AndroidViewModel` and run on `viewModelScope`
- Audio is 16 kHz mono 16-bit PCM (`ENCODING_PCM_16BIT`, `CHANNEL_IN_MONO`); WAV headers are written manually with `writeIntLE`/`writeShortLE`
- TTS plays through `AudioTrack` with a sample-rate fallback loop; never rely on playback completion listeners
- Every OkHttp call runs on `Dispatchers.IO` inside `withContext()` - never block the main thread
- Settings are re-read from SharedPreferences before each service operation, never cached across one
- KDoc on public functions and classes; `android.util.Log.d/w/e`, quiet when `debugLoggingEnabled=false`

## Common Commands
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug          # debug APK -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew test                   # unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest   # instrumentation tests
./gradlew clean && ./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies
```
Device launch/install commands are in `AGENTS.local.md`.

## Important Patterns & Idioms
- **Streaming**: `ApiClient.chatCompletion()` delivers deltas through `onChunk`; the full text is finalised after the `[DONE]` marker. Reasoning is separated by a `\u0001` chunk separator and by `parseReasoningAndContent()` (`<think>`/`<reasoning>`/`<thinking>`, plus OpenAI `reasoning_content`).
- **Wake chat holds one exchange, not a log**: turns accumulate while the card is open and are cleared when the exchange ends.
- **Close clock**: `touchChat()` stamps activity (each streamed chunk, the user's tap, the start of an exchange); the service waits until real silence reaches `wakeChatCloseSeconds`.
- **Retry**: `executeWithRetry(operationName, maxRetries = 3, delayMs = 1000)` wraps API calls in `VoiceAssistantService`.
- **Room DAO is not wired to the ViewModels** - message lists are `StateFlow<List<ChatMessage>>`.

## Things the Agent Should NEVER Do
- Never hardcode API endpoints - always read them from `AppSettings` via `SettingsRepository`
- Never make blocking network calls on the main thread - OkHttp calls belong in coroutines on `Dispatchers.IO`
- Never add an external wake-word runtime (Porcupine/Snowboy/rustpotter as a native library) - this toolchain has **no C FFI**, so a Rust `.so` cannot be loaded; the matcher is the pure-Kotlin port in `ui/common/WakeWordDetector.kt`
- Never trigger the wake word from the STT transcript - the trigger is on-device (`WakeWordDetector`); STT may only transcribe the request after the phrase matched
- Never remove the foreground-service notifications - required by API 35+ and declared in the manifest
- Never commit API keys or base URLs that carry credentials
- Never use `kotlinx.serialization` for preset JSON - presets are hand-built in `SettingsRepository`

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests in `app/src/test/java/`, instrumentation tests in `app/src/androidTest/java/`
- Mock the OkHttp client (or wiremock) for network paths; test TTS playback across sample rates
- Validate `AudioRecord` buffer sizing on low-end devices

## Configuration
- Settings persist under SharedPreferences key `"settings"` (MODE_PRIVATE); presets are `preset_<uuid>` entries plus a `presets_list` name list
- Every endpoint URL is configurable at runtime through `SettingsScreen`

## Deep details — read on demand (not loaded with this file)
These are deliberately **not** inlined here. Read them with file tools when the task needs them;
never paste them back into this guide.
- `docs/wake-word-pipeline.md` - the wake path end to end: capture → cut → MFCC → band-limited DTW →
  threshold → idle loop, every constant and why it has that value, the log tags and what a healthy
  enrollment looks like in them, and the traps. **Read this before touching any part of the wake
  path** - the stages are calibrated to each other, so a change in one is only correct if it is
  mirrored in the others.
- `.qwen/skills/localassistant-deep-dive/SKILL.md` - the device-verified gotcha log: the wake matcher,
  the `VoiceInteractionService`/`VoiceInteractionSessionService` platform path, session window sizing,
  TTS and SSE pitfalls, and this toolchain's API limits. Auto-loaded when Kotlin files are touched.
- `AGENTS.local.md` - machine endpoints, adb device and deploy commands. Git-ignored, per-machine.
